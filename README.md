App to check the availability of a web and show the related desktop notification / tray icon.

Sounds silly but if the company where you work blocks sites like Spotify in an unpredictable manner (some days is fully blocked, some days is available, although with full moon and maybe only after lunch is also available...crazy) this app starts having sense.

Programmed by pure fun after my kids fall asleep.
